**assigneeType** | [**AssigneeTypeEnum**](#AssigneeTypeEnum) | The nominal user type used to determine the assignee for issues created with this component. See &#x60;realAssigneeType&#x60; for details on how the type of the user, and hence the user, assigned to issues is determined. Can take the following values:   *  &#x60;PROJECT_LEAD&#x60; the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the project the component is in.  *  &#x60;COMPONENT_LEAD&#x60; the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the lead for the component.  *  &#x60;UNASSIGNED&#x60; an assignee is not set for issues created with this component.  *  &#x60;PROJECT_DEFAULT&#x60; the assignee to any issues created with this component is nominally the default assignee for the project that the component is in.

**assignee** | **AllOfComponentAssignee** | The details of the user associated with &#x60;assigneeType&#x60;, if any. See &#x60;realAssignee&#x60; for details of the user assigned to issues created with this component. |  [optional]
**realAssigneeType** | [**RealAssigneeTypeEnum**](#RealAssigneeTypeEnum) | The type of the assignee that is assigned to issues created with this component, when an assignee cannot be set from the &#x60;assigneeType&#x60;.

This property is set to one of the following values:   *  &#x60;PROJECT_LEAD&#x60; when &#x60;assigneeType&#x60; is &#x60;PROJECT_LEAD&#x60; and the project lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.  *  &#x60;COMPONENT_LEAD&#x60; when &#x60;assignee&#x60;Type is &#x60;COMPONENT_LEAD&#x60; and the component lead has permission to be assigned issues in the project that the component is in.  *  &#x60;UNASSIGNED&#x60; when &#x60;assigneeType&#x60; is &#x60;UNASSIGNED&#x60; and Jira is configured to allow unassigned issues.  *  &#x60;PROJECT_DEFAULT&#x60; when none of the preceding cases are true. |  [optional]
